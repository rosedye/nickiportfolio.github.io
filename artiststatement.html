<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
                <p>    For myself, personally, I have always believed that the ultimate way for an artist to make the best use of their skills, would be to leave a legacy of sorts behind. That is, to tell a story; not only is it what makes historical art documentations of the past so near and dear to my heart, but it brings the art of Animation and similar mediums even closer. I enjoy drawing characters, and building stories and worlds that have a substance around them, inspired by the world and events surrounding me. I also love to create my own work based on currently existing forms of media that inspire me. Cartoons, comics, etc., aside from creating my own story, I'd also love to assist in the process of creating someone else's, bringing storyboards and sequential art to my attention. Overall, the sense of a story, and ability to create a fictinal world, is what inspires me to draw.<br><br> Simply put, my ultimate goals would be to leave something behind, for others to enjoy when I'm gone. Whether it be an independent story I write and illustrate, or my work in the field of Animation, as a storyboard artist. I am very concerned with creating something within my lifetime. Drawing for myself is not only extremely enjoyable, but, I get the most joy out of seeing a finished product of something I thought of, and created, with my own two hands. I'd really like for someone to look back fondly on what I've left behind, which will likely be one or more fully fleshed out fictional universes that I've cultivated within the confines of my own head. Knowing that someone might enjoy characters that I create, has a sense of odd pride welling up within me, just at the thought of it. To have someone feel the exact same type of joy that I felt whenever I found a new favorite story, characters, and a new world to immerse myself in as an escape--- giving all of that to someone else would be the ultimate reward for my efforts.
